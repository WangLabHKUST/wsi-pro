wsi image processing pipeline

## Introduction
This is our wsi image processing pipeline to make it easier for researchers to use on their datasets.  

There are four major parts:  
1. pre-processing  
2. data augmentation  
3. data loading  
4. post-processing.

## Dependencies
1. Preprocssing functions are a fork of Deron Eriksson's python-wsi-preprocessing code:  
original project: https://github.com/deroneriksson/python-wsi-preprocessing  
In our fork, we have added some features to allow for more general use cases:
